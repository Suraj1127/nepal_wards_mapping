# Overview

In the last few decades, Nepal has seen major political and structural changes of which federalism is the one. The process of splitting and merging of VDC/municipality wards has been going even before the federalism era but once federalism was introduced the structuring became totally different than what it was. From around 4000 VDC/municipalities, the merging/splitting process resulted in around 3300 VDC/municipalities before the federal structuring was done. Once federal structuring was done, the new level, Local Government Unit (LGU), was introduced which consisted of wards. Ward is the lowest level of new federal structure. As of now, there are 753 LGUs and 6743 wards of which detailed data per province (in GIS map) is given [here](http://103.69.124.141/).

The World Bank, Nepal Country Office, has produced ward-wise mappings from the old structure to new federal structure for its internal use and has made the mapping public in GitHub. There are two separate mappings, one from 2011 structure to 2018 federal structure and another from 2014 structure to 2018 federal structure.

# Mappings
## old_wards_2011_to_new_wards_2018.csv
It contains the mapping at the ward level from 2011 structure to 2018 post-federalism structure.

The columns, *Zone*, *District 2011*, *Old Survey Dept VDC Name 2011*, *Old Survery Dept VDC Code 2011*, *Old Ward No. 2011* and *Old Survey Dept Ward Code 2011*,
represent the administrative structure information for 2011. The corresponding columns, *Province*, *New District 2018*, *CBS District Code 2018*, *Category of LU 2018*, *LU Name 2018*, *LU Full Name 2018*, *LU Name Nepali 2018*, *CBS LU Code 2018*, *LU Ward No. 2018* and *CBS LU Ward Code 2018*,
represent the administrative structure information for 2018.

## old_wards_2014_to_new_wards_2018.csv
In 2014 too, there was administrative re-structuring for some of the VDCs/municipalities though not due to federalism. 
Therefore, We have produced mapping for 2014 structure too.

It contains the mapping at the ward level from 2014 structure to 2018 post-federalism structure.

The columns, *District*, *VDC/Municipality Name*, *OLD_WARD_NO*,
represent the administrative structure information for 2014. The corresponding columns, *Province*, *District Code*, *Category of LU*, *LU Name*, *LU Name CBS*, *LU Name Nepali*, *LU HLCIT Code*, *LU CBS Code*, *NEW_WARD_NO* and *LU CBS Ward Code*,
represent the administrative structure information for 2018.
